# Getting Started

This section contains topics that explain how to set up the *Camera Streaming Daemon* (CSD) on a Linux computer. 

The topic [Building/Running CSD](../getting_started/building_installation.md) provides full instructions on how to [configure](../getting_started/building_installation.md#configure), build and run CSD.

> **Tip** The CSD runs on any Linux platform. We recommend OEMs build/develop on Ubuntu LTS 16.04 and then copy CSD to their target companion computer.

We also provide "Quickstart" topics with additional/turnkey instructions to set up CSD in common configurations:
- [Intel Aero](../getting_started/quick_start_intel_aero.md) — Build on Ubuntu and deploy to Aero.
- [Ubuntu Camera](../getting_started/quick_start_ubuntu_gazebo.md) — Connect to webcams attached to Ubuntu.
- [Gazebo Camera](../getting_started/quick_start_ubuntu_webcam.md) — Connect to Gazebo/SITL cameras (on Ubuntu).
